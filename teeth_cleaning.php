            Teeth Cleaning
        </h1>
        <p>
        Teeth cleaning is an essential dental procedure that removes plaque, tartar, and stains to maintain healthy gums and teeth. Professional cleaning prevents cavities, gum disease, and bad breath by eliminating bacteria buildup. Using advanced scaling and polishing techniques, dentists ensure a deep clean that regular brushing can't achieve. Routine cleanings every six months improve oral hygiene and prevent serious dental issues. A fresh, clean mouth not only enhances your smile but also supports overall health and well-being.
