    <p>
    Dental implant treatment is an advanced and highly effective procedure designed to replace missing teeth by inserting a titanium post into the jawbone. This post acts as an artificial tooth root, providing a strong and stable foundation for a custom-made crown, bridge, or denture. Unlike traditional dentures or bridges, implants are permanent, durable, and function like natural teeth, making them the preferred choice for tooth replacement.

                    The dentist evaluates oral health using X-rays and scans, determining the best implant option based on jawbone strength.

                    A titanium implant is surgically placed into the jawbone, where it fuses over time to create a stable foundation. A temporary crown may be placed during healing.

                    Once healed, a custom crown is attached, completing the restoration. The dentist ensures comfort, and patients receive aftercare instructions for long-term success.
