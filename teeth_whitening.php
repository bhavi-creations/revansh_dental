        Teeth whitening is a safe and effective cosmetic procedure that removes stains and discoloration, giving you a brighter smile. Using professional-grade bleaching agents, dentists lighten teeth several shades in just one session. This treatment is ideal for removing stains from coffee, tea, smoking, and aging. Whether done in-office or with take-home kits, teeth whitening enhances confidence and oral aesthetics. With long-lasting results and minimal sensitivity, it’s a quick and non-invasive way to achieve a radiant smile.

                        The dentist examines the teeth and determines the current shade. The best whitening method (in-office laser whitening or take-home kits) is chosen based on the patient’s needs.

                        A protective gel is applied to the gums, followed by a whitening agent on the teeth. A laser or LED light may be used to enhance the whitening process, breaking down stains effectively.

                        The dentist evaluates the results and provides aftercare instructions, including avoiding staining foods and drinks for a few days. Proper oral hygiene helps maintain the brightness.
