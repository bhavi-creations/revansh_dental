            Laser flap surgery is a modern, minimally invasive procedure for treating advanced gum disease. Using laser technology, dentists remove infected gum tissue, promote healing, and regenerate healthy gums with precision. This technique reduces pain, bleeding, and recovery time compared to traditional gum surgery. It effectively treats deep gum pockets, preventing tooth loss and improving oral health. Laser flap surgery offers a faster, safer, and more comfortable solution for patients suffering from periodontal disease.

                        The dentist examines the patient’s oral health and identifies the need for laser treatment. The procedure type (gum contouring, cavity removal, or whitening) is determined based on the patient’s needs.

                        A specialized dental laser is used to perform the treatment with high precision and minimal discomfort. Since lasers reduce bleeding and promote faster healing, the procedure is quick and painless.

                        The dentist provides post-treatment care instructions, ensuring optimal healing. Patients are advised to follow good oral hygiene and avoid certain foods for a short period to support recovery.
