    <p>
    Dental implant treatment is an advanced and highly effective procedure designed to replace missing teeth by inserting a titanium post into the jawbone. This post acts as an artificial tooth root, providing a strong and stable foundation for a custom-made crown, bridge, or denture. Unlike traditional dentures or bridges, implants are permanent, durable, and function like natural teeth, making them the preferred choice for tooth replacement.
