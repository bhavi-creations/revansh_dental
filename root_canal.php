  Root Canal
    </h1>
    <p>
    A root canal is a highly effective procedure to save a severely decayed or infected tooth. The treatment involves removing infected pulp, cleaning the canal, and sealing it with a protective filling. Modern techniques make root canals virtually painless, preserving natural teeth and preventing extraction. With proper care, a treated tooth can last a lifetime. This procedure relieves pain, restores function, and prevents further dental issues, ensuring a healthy and strong smile.
